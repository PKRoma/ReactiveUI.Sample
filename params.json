{"name":"Reactiveui.Sample","body":"## ReactiveUI.Sample 3.0\r\n\r\nThis sample app demonstrates the Best Practices™ way to write an application\r\nusing ReactiveUI 3.0. It also tries to show off as many features as possible\r\nof RxUI, while teaching the Zen of the framework.\r\n\r\nThe application itself is a WPF 4.0 application to display your Issues on\r\nGitHub, modeled after the GH Issues app for iPhone.\r\n\r\n## Annoying Note\r\n\r\nAt the moment, you must have .NET 4.5 Beta installed to run the code, and you\r\nmust apply a binding redirect to your test runner for JSON.NET in order to run\r\nthe tests. Both of these issues should be resolved in the near future, so this\r\nshould be as simple as checking out and building any other app.\r\n\r\nThis sample is also currently using a hacked version of RxUI 3.0 for test\r\npurposes, but it will soon use RxUI 3.0.5 which will soon be on NuGet once the\r\nRx issues around .NET 4.5 are resolved.","tagline":"Sample 3.0™","google":""}
